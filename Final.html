	<section id="first">
	<h3>What are we?</h3>
	<p>The Active Citizen was created on the belief that governance is a sacred trust between those who govern and those that are governed. This
	site exists because that trust has been broken and abused by those who have power. This site
		will collect data regarding government spending so American citizens learn more about where
	and how their government spends their money.</p>
	</section>
	
	  	<section id="second">
		  	<h3>What we believe:</h3>
			<p>Citizenship in this republic not only gives us inalienable rights but also responsibilities to our fellow citizens, our constitution and our nation. 
			Few in this country would say this country is going in the right direction. We believe that America is now dominated by passive citizens, citizens who only take a passing interesting in the matters that influence their lives while devoting their passions into endless entertainment. Bread and Circuses now rules this land with TV and the internet our Colosseum of the 21st century. For this republic to change course, we must become active citizens, those who are informed and involved in the public affairs that affect us all.  </p>
		  </section>
		  <section id="third">
			  <h3>What we stand for:</h3>
			  <p>We want to raise awareness of the corruption and abuse of power that exists at all levels of government. Only a more informed citizenry will be able to change the trend towards passive acceptance of tyranny.</p>
